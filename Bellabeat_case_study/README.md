# Bellabeat Case Study

[View the detailed project approach here](./Approach.md), covering each phase of the analysis process from Ask to Act.

## Executive Summary
This project analyzes users' activity, sleep, and heart rate data to inform strategic recommendations for Bellabeat’s wellness platform. The analysis identifies trends in user health behaviors and suggests targeted interventions to enhance user engagement and health outcomes.

- **Purpose**: To analyze wellness data and provide actionable insights for Bellabeat’s IVY+ product, focusing on users' activity levels, sleep patterns, and heart rate metrics.
- **Methodology**: Data analysis was conducted using SQL and R, comparing user metrics to industry benchmarks from NHIS and WHO.

## Objectives
- **Primary Goal**: Understand user behaviour and health patterns to provide insights for Bellabeat’s wellness interventions.
- **Sub-Objectives**:
  - Examine users’ weekly activity, sleep duration, and heart rate data to uncover trends.
  - Compare user metrics to NHIS and WHO standards to highlight areas for improvement.
  - Develop recommendations that align with Bellabeat's goal of promoting holistic wellness.

## Data Overview
The project utilizes three main datasets to examine wellness trends:
- **NHIS Baseline Data**: Contains benchmarks for physical activity and sleep based on national health survey data.
- **Weekly User Data**: Includes activity data like steps, vigorous/moderate activity minutes, sleep, and average heart rate.
- **WHO Recommendations**: Provides global standards for physical activity and sleep, used as a comparison benchmark.

Data preparation and pre-processing were conducted in SQL and R, focusing on cleaning and aggregating key metrics.

## Analysis and Findings
This section presents an overview of the key analyses and insights from the data:

1. **Weekly Steps Analysis**
   - **Objective**: Assess user activity levels based on weekly steps.
   - **Findings**: Step counts varied significantly, with some users consistently meeting higher activity levels. Lower-activity users indicate a need for personalized engagement strategies.

2. **Vigorous and Moderate Activity Analysis**
   - **Objective**: Evaluate the balance between vigorous and moderate activity levels.
   - **Findings**: While some users engaged in intense activities, several fell below the WHO activity baseline, suggesting opportunities for tailored activity recommendations.

3. **Sleep Duration Analysis**
   - **Objective**: Compare users’ sleep duration to NHIS baselines.
   - **Findings**: Many users logged less sleep than recommended, highlighting a need for sleep-focused features like reminders or insights.

4. **Heart Rate Analysis**
   - **Objective**: Assess users' average weekly heart rates for potential stress indicators.
   - **Findings**: Variations in heart rate were observed, particularly among users with irregular activity. Heart rate monitoring and stress-reduction recommendations could be beneficial.

## Recommendations
Based on the findings, we suggest the following actions for Bellabeat:
- **Increase Physical Activity for Low-Activity Users**: Personalized step challenges and gradual targets.
- **Support Vigorous and Moderate Activity Goals**: Tailored workout plans to meet WHO standards.
- **Enhance Sleep Improvement Programs**: Features promoting adequate sleep, such as sleep reminders.
- **Heart Rate Monitoring and Alerts**: Real-time alerts for unusual heart rate levels, combined with stress-management suggestions.
- **Personalized Goal Tracking**: Weekly goal setting and progress tracking.
- **User Engagement Incentives**: Reward systems for achieving wellness goals consistently.

## Conclusion
The analysis of user data reveals patterns in activity, sleep, and heart rate that Bellabeat can leverage to provide tailored wellness interventions. These recommendations can improve user engagement and support health outcomes aligned with Bellabeat’s mission.
