# Data Analytics Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Analytics Portfolio! This repository contains my data analytics projects, case studies, and visualizations, developed as part of my transition from program management to data analytics. Here, I showcase my skills in SQL, R, Tableau, and other tools for data analysis and visualization.

## 📁 Projects

### 1. Bellabeat Case Study
   - **Objective**: Analyze Fitbit data to uncover trends in wellness behavior and provide recommendations for Bellabeat's new product, IVY+.
   - **Skills Used**: SQL, R, Tableau, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualization.
   - **Key Findings**:
     - **Activity Levels**: Users with higher activity levels had significantly higher daily step counts and calories burned, which suggests Bellabeat could target users interested in improving daily activity through personalized activity goals.
     - **Sleep Patterns**: Most users logged an average sleep duration below the recommended 7-8 hours, highlighting an opportunity for Bellabeat to create sleep improvement features, like sleep insights or reminders.
     - **Heart Rate Monitoring**: Users with irregular activity levels displayed varying heart rates, which could be addressed by offering heart rate monitoring and alert features.
     - **Stress Reduction**: Analysis showed a pattern of increased sedentary minutes among users, suggesting that wellness insights and stress-reducing activities could add value to users' wellness journeys.
